# OpenSearch-compatible `_search` adapter

GrowlerDB ships an optional, read-path-first adapter that speaks a documented subset of the
OpenSearch `_search` Query DSL (decision D4). It exists for client and tool ecosystem
compatibility and migration; the native [`/v1/search`](rest-api) PK API remains the primary,
first-class surface.

It is off by default. Enable it on the gateway:

```sh
growlerdb gateway --node-addr http://node:50051 --opensearch ...
```

Then point an OpenSearch client at the gateway's REST port:

```sh
curl -s localhost:8081/myindex/_search -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "query": { "bool": {
    "must":   [{ "match": { "title": "alert" } }],
    "filter": [{ "range": { "ts": { "gte": "1700000000" } } }]
  }},
  "size": 20,
  "sort": [{ "ts": "desc" }]
}'
```

## How it works

The adapter translates the DSL into GrowlerDB's native query string, which the engine parses
into its [canonical AST](query-language) and executes through the normal search
path. Results are then shaped as OpenSearch documents:

- `_id` is synthesized from the composite key:
  the partition field values, then the identifier values, joined by `#` (e.g. `42#u1`).
- `_source` is filled by PK hydration ([`GetByKey`](rest-api)): the
  authoritative row from Iceberg, governed by the catalog. Search stays
  PK-based internally; the client sees documents.
- The response carries `took`, `timed_out`, `_shards`, and `hits.total` (a true cross-shard count).
  A down shard sets `_shards.failed`, so there is never a silent gap.

The `Authorization` / tenant headers are forwarded to the engine, so the adapter is governed by the
same auth + tenant scoping as the native API.

## Supported query DSL

| Clause | Support | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `match_all` | ✅ | `MatchAll` (via the `*:*` idiom, a cheap all-docs query) |
| `match` | ✅ | analyzed term(s); multi-token ⇒ OR of tokens |
| `match_phrase` | ✅ | `Phrase` (ordered, adjacency) |
| `multi_match` | ✅ | OR of `field:value` across `fields` |
| `term` | ✅ | `Term` (exact / analyzed per field type) |
| `terms` | ✅ | OR of `Term`s |
| `range` (`gte`/`gt`/`lte`/`lt`) | ✅ | `Range` with inclusive/exclusive bounds |
| `bool` (`must`/`filter`/`must_not`/`should`) | ✅ | `Bool` (see `should`/`filter` caveats) |
| `exists`, `prefix`, `wildcard`, `fuzzy`, `regexp`, `ids`, … | ❌ | clear `501` error |

### Request body
- `from` / `size` → offset / page size (default `size` = 10).
- `sort` → native sort keys. Accepts `"field"`, `{ "field": "asc"|"desc" }`, and
  `{ "field": { "order": ... } }`. `_score` entries are dropped (native ranks by score by default).
- `highlight` → opt into server-side highlighting. `fields` (the map keys) names the TEXT fields
  to highlight; `number_of_fragments` → max fragments per field and `fragment_size` → the fragment
  window (top-level or per-field, a per-field value winning). Each hit then carries a standard
  OpenSearch `highlight` object (`field → ["…<em>term</em>…"]`, HTML-escaped). Custom pre/post tags,
  `type`, and `order` are ignored; GrowlerDB emits `<em>`-marked, escaped fragments.
- `query` absent → match-all.
- Temporal bounds. A `range`/`term`/`terms` value against a date field is interpreted in
  that field's declared unit (`epoch_seconds`/`_millis`/`_micros`/`_nanos`, …) and converted to
  the canonical epoch-micros GrowlerDB stores, so `{"range": {"ts": {"gte": 1700000000}}}` on a
  seconds field matches, rather than being read as micros and pruning to nothing. This holds for
  every date search field, not just a windowed index's windowing field: the gateway learns each
  field's unit from the control plane's index mapping. Fields declared as native micros (no format)
  pass through unchanged.

## Caveats (documented limitations, not bugs)

- `bool.should` is honored for matching only when there is no `must`/`filter` (matching
  OpenSearch's default `minimum_should_match`). With a `must`/`filter` present, `should` is
  scoring-only in OpenSearch and not expressible in the query string, so it is dropped from the
  predicate. `minimum_should_match` is not supported.
- `bool.filter` is treated like `must` (a required conjunct). The non-scoring distinction isn't
  modelled by the read adapter.
- Value charset. `term`/`terms`/`range`/`match` token values must be simple tokens (no
  whitespace or query metacharacters); a value like `"a b"` or `"a:b"` returns a clear `501`
  pointing you to the native API. `match_phrase` accepts spaces (it becomes a quoted phrase).
- Write path, aggregations, scripting, mappings, and percolators are out of scope. Use
  GrowlerDB's connectors for ingestion and `/v1/search` aggregations
  for analytics.

Unsupported input always returns a structured error (`{"error": {"type", "reason"}, "status"}`)
rather than a wrong result.
